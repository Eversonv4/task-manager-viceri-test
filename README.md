# Task Manager - Viceri

This project aims to put fundamental skills and knowledge in Angular into practice. Task information was saved in Local Storage. The project consists of two main pages: one with a panel with four columns, representing task statuses. We also have tasks in card format, where you can create a new task, edit it and move and drag a task to another column. The next page consists of a list of all tasks, where we can search for a specific task, filtering by status or searching by keywords

## Design

For the application design, I chose a lighter look and with colors in lighter tones. The font applied is easy to read, which contributes positively to the accessibility and comprehensibility of the information provided.

- SASS
- HTML
